Most rehabilitative exercise programs involve walking, and thus prosthetic feet are required for proper care. Currently, there is little research on the prescription of prosthetic feet to SMs with lower limb amputations. This information can assist in clinician decision-making and preparation for future conflicts by quantifying the number of devices typically prescribed, the types of devices, and the activities this population often returns to.  **METHODS** Data was taken from a total of 109 subjects in this study. Subjects were eligible if they had DoD healthcare beneficiary status, were 18 years of age or older, had a unilateral transtibial amputation, and obtained prosthetic care between January 2009 and June 2016 at the specified facility. Information about the individual prosthetic devices was obtained from manufacturer websites, private prosthetist websites, and in-person consultations with prosthetists.  **RESULTS** There was a total of 597 prosthetic feet prescribed, with an average of 5.48 feet prescribed in the first two years of care. The mean time until the first foot was received was 54.69 days, and the median was 26 days. The prosthetics were split into two categories: daily use accounted for 64.2 percent of prescriptions and activity specific use accounted for 35.8 percent. The two most common types of activity specific feet were running (70.2 percent) and water use (19.2 percent).  **DISCUSSION** Many of the prescribed devices were activity specific, especially for running and water use activities. This information can be used to guide rehabilitative program goals in the future. While these numbers are likely an underestimation, they can be used as a starting point which may help prepare hospitals and clinics for future costs of rehabilitative care after a conflict.","tags":[],"title":"Prosthetic Feet Prescribed to Service Members with Unilateral Transtibial Amputation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Heller JB","**Roddy WT**","Isaacson BM","Hager NH","Pasquina PF"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579582800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579582800,"objectID":"528f3020b1f916ff60bd270b52490946","permalink":"/publication/mirror-da-ewi-2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mirror-da-ewi-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"**INTRODUCTION** Data is one of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) greatest assets yet is often difficult to integrate, abstract, and align with operational needs. To offset this problem, the Musculoskeletal Injury Rehabilitation Research for Operational Readiness (MIRROR) organization was created to deliver data and analytics support to the military health system (MHS). Headquartered at the Uniformed Services University (USU), MIRROR conducts studies requiring epidemiological data, investigator initiated trials, and prospective randomized multi-site clinical trials.  **METHODS** MIRROR has identified a primary need for two accessible, extensible, and DoD compliant data and analytics solutions: a solution enabling data to be electronically captured and managed, and a solution enabling sophisticated reporting and analytics of this data. MIRROR has worked with stakeholders to identify and support end-user, information security, and human protections requirements. MIRROR considered a range of data solutions including Microsoft Access, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), and Qualtrics as well as analytics solutions including Microsoft Power BI and Tableau.  **RESULTS** Central to the MIRROR data and analytics infrastructure implementation is REDCap managed in collaboration with USU Information Technology. REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing survey instruments, clinical assessment items, and research databases built on non-proprietary technologies including PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. It is hosted on a USU server with DoD Authority to Operate for compliance. Microsoft Power BI and Tableau are being tested for interoperability.  **DISCUSSION and CONCLUSION** Within the MHS, data and analytics activities are commonly coordinated on an ad hoc basis using solutions like Microsoft Excel. This approach often acts as a barrier to efficient research and fails to scale. The development of a shared data and analytics infrastructure across MIRROR projects enables program information and insights to be communicated in an efficient, timely, and approachable manner. Ultimately, this allows MIRROR research to be advanced in a data-driven way.","tags":[],"title":"Data and Analytics Infrastructure to Advance Musculoskeletal Injury Rehabilitation Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scarton DV","**Roddy WT**","Taylor JA","Geda M","Brandt C","Peduzzi P","Kerns R","Pasquina P"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579064400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579064400,"objectID":"52f9215b503802f05767d1d14b84e32a","permalink":"/publication/mtfec-milmed-2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-15T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mtfec-milmed-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Within the population of military service members and veterans, chronic pain is highly prevalent, often complex, and frequently related to traumatic experiences that are more likely to occur to members of this demographic, such as individuals with traumatic brain injury or limb loss. In September 2017, the NIH-DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC) was formed as a significant and innovative inter-government agency partnership to support a multi-component research initiative focusing on non-pharmacological approaches for pain management addressing the needs of service members and veterans. A Pain Management Collaboratory Coordinating Center (PMC3) was also established to facilitate collective learning across the PCTs and to optimize the impact of the PMC as an integrated whole. Although the DoD and VA health systems are ideal sites for the enactment of PCTs, executing these trials within the local context of military treatment facilities (MTFs) can present unique challenges. The Military Treatment Facility Engagement Committee (MTFEC) was created to support the efforts of the PMC3 in its role as a national resource for development and refinement of innovative tools, best practices, and other resources in the conduct of high impact PCTs. The MTFEC is comprised of experts from each service who bring experiences in executing clinical pain management trials that can enhance the planning phase of the PCTs. It provides expertise and leadership in the execution of research studies within the Military Health System (MHS), with guidance from PMC3 Directors and in collaboration with NIH, DoD and VA program and scientific officers. Considering the importance of enacting large-scale, pragmatic studies and strategies to implement effective strategies in clinical practice for chronic pain management, the MTFEC has fulfilled its purpose to identify potential barriers with study implementation and explore how the PMC can support and aid in the execution of PCTs by applying similar approaches to stakeholder and subject matter engagement for their research.","tags":[],"title":"Development and Implementation of the Military Treatment Facility Engagement Committee (MTFEC) to support Pragmatic Clinical Trials in the Military Health System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geda M","Gordon K","Burgess D","George S","Pasquina P","**Roddy WT**","Scarton D","Brandt C","Kerns R","Peduzzi P","on behalf of the NIH-DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577768400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577768400,"objectID":"71084fb93b802a0fcc41d04db6e48311","permalink":"/publication/pmc-overlapping-sites-2020/","publishdate":"2019-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pmc-overlapping-sites-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Strategy for Addressing Overlapping Sites in the NIH-DOD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scarton DV","**Roddy WT**","Taylor JA","Geda M","Brandt C","Peduzzi P","Kerns R","Pasquina P"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566273600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566273600,"objectID":"4d31bd86c99a591b2b188de4cc176368","permalink":"/publication/mtfec-mhsrs-2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-20T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mtfec-mhsrs-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"As a result of recent combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military has been entrusted to care for over 1,700 service members and veterans who have experienced traumatic limb loss, 82.7% of which have been of the lower limb. Beyond the physical and psychological difficulties of adapting to life after limb loss, individuals with amputations are at a higher risk for developing secondary complications, such as joint pain, osteoarthritis, chronic back pain, cardiovascular disease, and phantom limb pain., Optimizing rehabilitation strategies in caring for service members with amputation may not only improve their functional performance, but will also likely mitigate many of these long-term risks. While the Department of Defense has established three Advanced Rehabilitation Centers (ARCs) that specialize in a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary rehabilitative care utilizing the latest technology in prosthetics and assistive devices, further research is needed to help optimize those rehabilitation interventions, particularly as related to establishing individualized guidelines for prescribed intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise regiments.

For wounded warriors, the complex nature of combat injuries often leads to multiple co-existing health conditions beyond limb loss, including traumatic brain injury, chronic or phantom limb pain, burn injuries, sensory impairments, and psychological health disturbances such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. Prior research studies have shown that individuals treated with an interdisciplinary model system of care self-reported higher scores for quality of life and health status, higher rates of prosthetic usage, and higher rates of satisfaction with care received. A multifaceted, unified team of providers, often including surgeons, prosthetists, physical and occupational therapists, behavioral and mental health experts, physiatrists, and educators and social workers, is essential to effectively rehabilitate patients with amputation injuries. This level of comprehensive healthcare necessitates substantial labor commitments and cost. Furthermore, differences may exist between post-amputation rehabilitation care for civilians and military healthcare beneficiaries that have not yet been illuminated. Literature suggests that civilian patients seeking physical therapy under Medicare are generally insured for up to 12 encounters per episode of care. One study reported mean and median expenditures per civilian appointment for ambulatory physical therapy to be $188 and $112, respectively, with a comparable average number of visits for persons with public and private insurance, as well as for persons with Medicare. In contrast, healthcare utilization within the military, specifically related to the rehabilitation needs of wounded warriors with amputations experienced as a result of injuries obtained during GWOT, has not been studied before. The present investigation aims to analyze and quantify the utilization of healthcare throughout the entire continuum of care for service members recovering from polytrauma at military treatment facilities (MTFs). In doing so, the study intends to facilitate a better understanding and potential for optimization of U.S. government resources to better support wounded warrior rehabilitation.  **Methods:** Quantifying the interdisciplinary approach to the rehabilitation of patients with major combat-related amputation(s) requires leveraging longitudinal data extracts from the U.S. Military Health System (MHS). Patients were identified using the EACE-R and identified in the MHS Data Repository (MDR). The MDR was used to query appointment-level details of patient’s engagement with clinics across Military Treatment Facilities. Data collected includes demographic information, clinic designation, diagnoses, procedures performed, and number and type of rehabilitation-related medical/therapy appointments. For the analysis presented, we determined the mean number of physical therapy (PT) visits for combat-wounded individuals with lower limb amputation between 2005 and 2017. PT appointments were defined as any appointment in a MTF clinic designated as an outpatient PT clinic. The data were filtered such that all subjects had to have 1) unilateral amputation, 2) either transfemoral or transtibial injury location, 3) no injury detail that would indicate a delayed or elective amputation, and 4) a PT appointment within 100 days of injury. The mean number of appointments were calculated for patients who continued care within the MHS through six months after injury and through 12 months after injury.  **Results:** Data extracts provided descriptive statistics regarding usage of PT clinics for individuals with transtibial and transfemoral amputation. The mean number of encounters were obtained for two time periods, 0-6 months post-injury (period 0-6) and 0-12 months post-injury (period 0-12). For N=278 transtibial males the mean number of PT visits was 37.3 (+/- 12.1) during period 0-6. N=150 transtibial males had a mean of 67.6 (+/-22.3) visits during period 0-12. N=5 transtibial females had a mean of 40.6 (+/- 3.4) visits during period 0-6, and N=2 transtibial females had a mean of 84.5 (+/- 26.2) visits. Male transfemoral patients in period 0-6 (N=132) had a mean of 39.3 (+/-10.4) visits; in period 0-12, N=83 transfemoral males had a mean of 72.7 (+/-18.7) visits. N=1 transfemoral female had 42 PT visits during period 0-6, and N=2 transfemoral females had a mean of 72 (+/- 5.7) PT visits during period 0-12.  **Conclusions:** The data highlights the complexity of long-term treatment of individuals with traumatic limb loss. Within the MHS, presenting injuries are diverse and care received is variable, as well as highly intensive. Patients treated in the MHS attend a far higher number of appointments than the literature suggests is common among civilian counterparts. In one cohort, the number of PT encounters was more than 5 times the number of civilian counterparts. This may be a result of complex injuries that require a longer rehabilitation period, and thus, more therapy appointments. Further analyses of detailed longitudinal person-level healthcare data from other rehabilitation clinics are needed to comprehensively describe healthcare utilization for this population. Additionally, it is important to consider that it has historically been difficult to quantify the intensity or “dosage” of encounters for therapy interventions. No research investigation to date has collated this magnitude of information to understand the overall utilization and cost of healthcare accessed by service members after sustaining combat-related polytrauma. The results of this research may have a far reaching impact in directing future planning for staffing needs within the MHS. Quantifying the number of therapy encounters is just the first step in understanding healthcare utilization and comprehensive rehabilitation care for this population.","tags":[],"title":"Rehabilitation and Clinic Utilization of Patients with Combat Related Amputation in the US Military Health System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kerns R","Brandt C","Peduzzi P","NIH-DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory (**Roddy WT**)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565668800,"objectID":"0e9a8816c48c952e35f03ab5c8482f42","permalink":"/publication/pmc-painmed-2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-13T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pmc-painmed-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"NIH-DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"\rR Markdown\rThis is an R Markdown document.
